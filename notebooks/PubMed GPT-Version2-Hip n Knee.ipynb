For instance, a study titled \"Short-term outcomes and benefits of ERAS program in elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery: a case-matched study compared to conventional care\" found a reduction of 2 days in length of hospital stay after implementing ERAS (2018). Similarly, a randomized controlled trial titled \"Compliance with enhanced recovery after surgery criteria and preoperative and postoperative counselling reduces length of hospital stay in colorectal surgery: results of a randomized controlled trial\" reported a significant decrease in total hospital stay among patients randomized to ERAS (2016).\\n\\n2. Reduction in Complication Rates: ERAS protocols have also been associated with a decrease in postoperative complications. The aforementioned study in 2018 reported a significant reduction of grade III/IV Dindo-Clavien\\'s postoperative complications with ERAS compared to conventional care. Another study titled \"Implementation and improvement of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols for colorectal cancer surgery\" also reported a significant decrease in the complication rate after starting the colon ERAS (2022).\\n\\n3. Reduction in Readmission Rates: While the impact of ERAS on readmission rates is not as clear-cut, the 2018 study found that readmission rates remained unaffected after implementing ERAS, suggesting that the program does not increase the risk of readmission.\\n\\n4. Cost-Effectiveness: While none of the provided articles specifically discuss cost-effectiveness, the reduction in length of stay and complication rates associated with ERAS suggest potential cost savings. Shorter hospital stays can reduce healthcare costs, and fewer complications can prevent costly readmissions and additional treatments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ERAS program appears to offer several benefits in colorectal surgery, including reduced length of hospital stay and complication rates, which may also lead to cost savings. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of ERAS on readmission rates and cost-effectiveness.'}"

Reduction in Length of Stay: ERAS protocols have been associated with a significant reduction in the duration of inpatient stays. For instance, a systematic review of 59 relevant studies showed reductions in the duration of inpatient stays in the ERAS groups compared with more traditional care (\"A systematic review of enhanced recovery protocols in colorectal surgery\", 2011). Another study found a reduction of 2 days in the length of hospital stay after implementing ERAS (\"Short-term outcomes and benefits of ERAS program in elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery: a case-matched study compared to conventional care\", 2018).

Reduction in Complication Rates: ERAS protocols have also been associated with reductions in morbidity and mortality rates.
